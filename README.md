C# Game + Unity- Seinor Capstone
Nick Northey

The idea of this game uses Unity and the C# language in Visual Studio to create a game. The game will involve a top-down point of view with a real-time based combat system. There are different levels of the mine with checkpoints and different minerals and enemies to kill. When the user gets to a certain level they will run into a boss that is guarding a checkpoint that needs to be claimed. Each boss should be different while the regular enemies will be similar. When the user gets to the main boss if they defeat them they have one the game.
