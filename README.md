C# Game + Unity- Seinor Capstone
Nick Northey

The idea of this game uses Unity and the C# language in Visual Studio to create a game. The game will involve a top-down point of view with a turn based combat system. The Game is based in a mine there are different levels with checkpoints and different minerals and enemies to kill. When the user gets to a certain level they will run into a boss that is guarding a checkpoint that needs to be claimed. Each boss should be different while the regular enemies will be similar. When the user gets to the main boss if they defeat them they have won the game.

What needs to be developed:
- Creation of Combat System
- Creation of Mining System
- Creation of Death System
- Creation of Experience System
- Creation of Normal Enemies
- Creation of First Sub Boss
- Creation of Final Boss
- Creation of Communication System
- fully Animate all Systyems


What has been done:
- General outline and layout created
- Base Idea created
- Creation of Movement System for Character - Rough start has been accomplished as player will move to where mouse was clicked.
