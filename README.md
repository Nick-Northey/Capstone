What is Knights of the Mine:
The idea of this game uses the C# language in Visual Studio to create a game called "Knights of the Mine". The game will involve a top-down point of view with a real-time based combat system. There are different levels of the mine with checkpoints and different minerals and enemies to kill. When the user gets to a certain level they will run into a boss that is guarding a checkpoint that needs to be claimed. Each boss should be different while the regular enemies will be similar.
