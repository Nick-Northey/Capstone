Python Game - Seinor Capstone - Knights of the Mine 
Nick Northey

What is Knights of the Mine:
The idea of this game uses the python language to create a game called "Knights of the Mine". This game will be based on a small village that is right outside of a dungeon mine that has been taken over by evil. The object of the game is to get to the bottom of the mine to defeat the final boss and re-claim the mine for the village and help rebuild it and rescue some of the villagers from the mine. There will be a few monsters in each level that will try and kill the user. the user will also collect different minerals as they go through the mine that will help them become stronger as the game progresses. If the user gets to a certain level they will be able to set a checkpoint here and go from that level to the village without having to go through the entire mine again. If the user dies their progress will be reset to the last checkpoint they reach. As the game progresses the user will also gain experience from killing monsters that they can use to build stats and gain skills. The materials the user mines will also be used to get better equipment and help rebuild the town for the villagers. There will be a few different important villagers that will interact with the user and help them improve the character, like the blacksmith, the cleric, the weapons master, and more to come.
